# Chat-App

I created a dynamic real-time chat application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to communicate seamlessly. The app features an intuitive user interface with a responsive design, making it accessible on various devices. Leveraging WebSocket technology, the chat application ensures instant message delivery, enabling smooth conversations without delays. Additionally, I incorporated user-friendly features like message notifications and a simple layout that enhances the overall user experience. This project showcases my skills in front-end development and real-time web technologies, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements and functionalities.
